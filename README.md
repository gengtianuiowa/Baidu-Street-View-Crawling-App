# Baidu-Street-View-Crawling-App
This was once for the research use in my undergraduate research project: Geographic disparities of street visual color schemes: Using Street View Imagery to inform urban color planning.</br>
I used this app to crawl street views from Baidu Street View, which has the greatest range of coverage of street view in China.</br>
Notice: There might be a cryptic algorithm behind the Baidu Street View to prevent large scale of data stealing. Therefore, the string which represents the location of the street view can not be decoded. So this app is based on utilizing URL rather than the coordinates.
